## Purpose of Case study

Lending club is the largest peer-to-peer marketplace connecting borrowers with lenders. Borrowers apply through an online platform where they are assigned an internal score. 
Lenders decide 
  1) whether to lend 
  2) 2) the terms of loan such as interest rate, monthly instalment, tenure etc.
